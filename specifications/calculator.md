Could you please add a calculator page to the frontend?

* Enter two numbers (react server-side component)
* Show an _Add_ button
* When _Add_ is pressed, call the backend API to add the two numbers
* Show the result

When you finished coding, do the following QA steps:

* Start backend and frontend as described in the AGENTS.md file
* Use a subagent to verify your changes in the browser. Let the subagent know the port of the frontend that it should use for testing.
